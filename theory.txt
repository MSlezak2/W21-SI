* What is an Operating System?

Operating System is a program that runs on a computer. It manages computer's resources
such as memory, CPU etc. It also orchestrates all the other programs that user intends 
to run on a device. 

* List some functions of an OS

One of the most important tasks of an operating system is to run other programs and manage
their execution. It grants resources (mostly memory and CPU time) to each of them based on
their priority. It also controlls devices such as disks, flash drives, monitors and so on.
It groups data into file systems to keep it in order. Finally, it enables users (be it 
a human user or just a different program) to interact with the computer.

* What is a kernel?
* What are the tasks of the kernel?

Kernel is the part of the OS that manages the hardware and various other low-level tasks. 
It comunicates with devices via their controllers and manages the processes among the others.
It's also responsible for memory management.

* What is user-space?

Virtual memory is divided into two sections - kernel and user space. In contrast to kernel
space, user space is available for custom programs. The purpose of that division is to prevent
potential (accidental or intentional) corruption of OS's memory by user defined programs.

* What is priviliged and what non-priviliged mode?

It's a security mechanism of the CPU created to avoid problems caused by execution of users' 
applications. It can execute instructions either in priviliged or non-priviliged mode. The
former has no limits while the latter has some instructions restricted (like access to memory).
OS leverages this feature, by granting priviliged mode to kernel functions and the other one
to the rest of the processess.

* What is a process?

Process is a task for OS to perform. In other words it's just a program. It contains of a set 
of instructions. In most cases the are more processes in a system than there is workers (CPU
cores), so there's a necessity for them to share the resource (process scheduling). Beside 
CPU time, each process has granted its separate area of the memory. Each process has its 
metadata such as an id or its state. At the particular moment it could be for instance running,
terminated or waiting for some event to occure.
